      <h1>A Trip To Australia</h1>
      <h2>Travelling with my family</h2>
      <p> <i class="fas fa-plane"></i>
           On 23 November 2019, My family and I went to Australia as a vacation.We
        went there for 8 days, 3 days at Melbourne,1 day at Philip Island and 4
        days at Sydney.It was a really exciting and relaxing trip. We took
        plenty of memorable photos as a memento.In this trip, we saw penguin,
        kangaroos and koalas...... They are very cute! Besides, we are also
        learnt how to take trams and the foods there were marvellousüòç

              <li>
                We went to the Rainbow House, Puffing Billy Railway, Chinatown and
                Victory Market in Melbourne.
              </li>
              <li>
                The most memorable place for me is <b>Victory Market</b>. In the market, we bought some jackets, shirts and many more clothes. We had also ate some delicious <b>Doughnut</b>, and the special characteristics of the doughnut is: it is a <b>hot doughnut</b>üòù.
              </li>
              <li>
                Besides, the <b>Rainbow House</b> had also took my attention. Because of the Rainbow house is at the <b>seaside</b>, so there was a very strong wind blowing to us and cause our hair become very messy üòÇ,but we had successfully took plenty of pictures there.
              </li>
              <p>
                In a nutshell, Melbourne is a really very good places for travelling and We felt happy and had a whale of time there.

              <li>
                The Penguin Parade at Phillip Island Nature Park, in which <b>little
                  penguins come ashore in groups</b>, attracts visitors from all over
                the world.
              </li>
              <li>
                They come to see one of the few areas where this species of
                penguin can be seen. Phillip Island is home to approximately
                <b>32,000</b> penguins, which can be seen by tourists at sunset every day of the year.
              </li>
              <p>
                The most regrettable things is we can't took phtos there, or else i will have some cute penguin's photos, but it is very special for me because this is the first time i can observe the penguin in a very short distance.

                In Sydney Opera House, there was a tuor guide who is leading us for visiting the Opera House, and the most unforgettable places for me in the Opera House is the <b>Concert Hall</b> and <b>Bennelong Restaurant</b>. The interior design is awesome and it is the most highclass and beautiful places i had ever seen. Therfore, there was crowded of tuorist in every opening hours.
